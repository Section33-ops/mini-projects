# Inventory Manager

## App Description
This is a simple command-line Inventory Manager built with Python.  
It lets users add, view, and update items in their inventory.  
I made it to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, and methods.

## How to Use
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.  
2. Open the folder `inventory-manager` in your terminal or command prompt.  
3. Run this command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4. Use the menu options to add, view, or update items.
5. Choose the exit option to close the app.

## App Features
- Add new items with name, price, and quantity.
- View all items currently in the inventory.
- Update the price or quantity of existing items.

## Possible Future Updates
- Remove items from the inventory.
- Save and load data from a file.
- Add categories or sorting options.
- Build a simple graphical version of the app.
